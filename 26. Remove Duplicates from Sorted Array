26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, 
remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element 
appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int j =0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length-1;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i+1])
            {
                nums[j+1]=nums[i+1];
                j=j+1;
            }
        }
        return j+1;
    }
}
